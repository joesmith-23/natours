# Natours Application

A substantially expanded version of the project from this Udemy Course - https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/

Natours is a tour holiday application where users can sign up and book adventure tours around the world.

It was built with Node.js Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and Pug. It includes a feature-rich API, advanced authorisation, emails sending, file uploading and manipulation and card payments with stripe.

The additional features implemented in this expanded version include the simple filter system on the homepage, a review input that is only available when a user has bought the tour they intend to review, populated 'My Tours' and 'My Reviews' pages and several quality of life tweaks and improvements with front end JS and simple CSS.
